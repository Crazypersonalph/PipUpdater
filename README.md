### Are you ever tired of having to upgrade all your packages when a new update comes, or some other thing breaks?
Sometimes, you might have HUNDREDS of packages, and it is impossible to keep track of them. \
### This is a python package being developed for PyPi, that will be able to upgrade all of your packages.

This is package is open-source, and in the public domain.
That means anybody can use, repackage, and you don't have to worry about anything when it comes to licensing.

Please spread the word!
Thanks!
